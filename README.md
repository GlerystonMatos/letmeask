## Available Scripts

From the project directory, you can run:

```bash
npm start
```

Run the application in development mode.

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.

You will also see any lint errors on the console.

Compile the application for production in the `build` folder:

```bash
npm run build
```

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for best performance.

The build is shortened and the filenames include the hashes.

```bash
npm install
```

Compile the application using TypeScript:

```bash
npx tsc
```
